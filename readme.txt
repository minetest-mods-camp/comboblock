------------------------------- Mod Folder Name -------------------------------------

The mod folder should only be called comboblock. Github on download will add a "-" 
then something: 
For releases download it'll add the release number to the end eg comboblock-5.2.0.1
For straight download it'll add the word master eg comboblock-master

Rename the folder to be just comboblock

-------------------------------- Version Number -------------------------------------
Comboblock has been given a version number that helps align it to the version of minetest
it was developed against. It dosen't mean it wont work with an older or new version of 
minetest. BUt if possible grab the release number that most closely matches the version of
minetest you are using. It is very unlikely that the Comboblock updated version will work with
any version of Minetest before version 5.0.

The first 3 numbers in the version number are the version of minetest it was created 
against/for the last digit is the mod version. 
Check the releases tab for specific old version releases. Feel free to download from the main
git repository but consider that it could be under development and broken in someway. 
So always best to download from the releases tab.

-------------------------------- Known Issues -------------------------------------
I'll try and keep this updated but check git as I'll try and keep them updated there.

Issue 1 - Glass and Non-Glass slabs can't be stacked togther. this is an engine limitation
          and if allowed results in some strange display behaviour when viewed in game.
		  
Issue 2 - If you rotate a comboblock with a screwdriver type tool (lots out there), the block
		  will always retain the propoerties of the block that was ontop. I haven't been able
		  work out a fix yet as Im trying to avoid changing the screwdriver(s) code.
		  
------------------------------------ Thanks ----------------------------------------
Big thanks to Pithy for writting the orginal mod and the help from various people on the 
MT forum boards even if they probably don't know they have helped:

blert2112, Linuxdirk, Krock, Rubenwardy, Pampogokiraly, Joe7575, Sorcerykid 

And of course the Coredevs and Celeron55 for designing/keeping the engine running 


Hope this mod is useful and not to buggy
