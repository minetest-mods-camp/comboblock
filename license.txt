Comboblock is licensed under unlicence except for the function 
"rotate and place" which has been copied unchanged from  the Stairs mod
inside the Minetest Game and is under LGPL 2.1

To the best of my understanding this dosen't create a conflict between 
these two licence as I am treating the function "rotate and place" as
a shared library component as per LGPL 2.1. However Im no legal expert 
so happy to adjust if needed.
